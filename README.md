This repository contains both a collection of Jupyter Notebooks as well as other resources (e.g. presentations, links, ...) that are going to be used during the "Second quarter university extension courses" that the University of Oviedo is going to teach (online). For more information about this course, you can check the following [URL](https://www.uniovi.es/estudios/extension/cursos2c/-/asset_publisher/SEp0PJi4ISGo/content/vision-por-computador-en-la-nueva-era-de-la-inteligencia-artificial-y-el-deep-learning?redirect=%2Festudios%2Fextension%2Fcursos2c)

Objectives
 * To know the current context of computer vision in the new era of artificial intelligence and Deep Learning
 * To know the main tools and strategies for problem solving using different data sources
 * Knowing how to handle computer tools and specific software for digital image processing
 * Understanding how basic digital image processing and analysis methods and techniques work

Content
 * Introduction to OpenCV and Python
 * Basic image treatment
 * Image processing
 * Machine learning (Scikit-learn)
 * Deep learning (Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch)
 
The target audience is broad and includes
 * People who have done computer science (maybe to graduate level) but who have not knowledge about OpenCV
 * People who are studying other subjects and want to play with computer vision
