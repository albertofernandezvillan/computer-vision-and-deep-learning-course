        "Imagine a study evaluating a test that screens people for a disease. Each person taking the test either has or does not have the disease. The test outcome can be positive (classifying the person as having the disease) or negative (classifying the person as not having the disease). Therefore, we can group the people under study in one of the four following groups:\n",
        "\n",
        " - **True positive (TP)**: Sick people (actual = 1) correctly identified as sick (predicted = 1)\n",
        " - **False positive (FP)**: Healthy people (actual = 0) incorrectly identified as sick (predicted = 1)\n",
        " - **True negative (TN)**: Healthy people (actual = 0) correctly identified as healthy (predicted = 0)\n",
        " - **False negative (FN)**: Sick people (actual = 1) incorrectly identified as healthy (predicted = 0)\n",
        "\n",
        "These four groups can be represented in the following figure (extracted from [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-data-science-classification-metrics-in-scikit-learn-in-python-3bc336865019)).\n",

It can be seen as \"*how sure you are that you are not missing any positives*\".\n",

        "\n",
        "**Precision** is intuitively the ability of the classifier not to label as positive a sample that is negative. Precision can also be referred as positive predictive values (PPV).

        "We can also show the confusion matrix using [`ConfusionMatrixDisplay`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay.html), which provides a nice visualization. Based on the documentation \"*It is recommend to use `plot_confusion_matrix` to create a `ConfusionMatrixDisplay`*\". The main problem of using [`plot_confusion_matrix`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.plot_confusion_matrix.html#sklearn.metrics.plot_confusion_matrix) is that requires an `estimator` as first argument. So, in this case, we have to use `ConfusionMatrixDisplay` directly because we have not defined a classifier."

        "\n",
        "When making a prediction for a binary or two-class classification problem, the two types of error that we could make are: false positive error and false negative error. By predicting probabilities and calibrating a threshold, a balance of these two errors can be stablished.\n",

        "An ROC space is defined by FPR and TPR as x and y axes, respectively, which depicts relative trade-offs between true positive (benefits) and false positive (costs). Since TPR is equivalent to sensitivity and FPR is equal to 1 − specificity, the ROC graph is sometimes called the sensitivity vs (1 − specificity) plot.\n",

        "\n",
        "- A random guess would give a point along a diagonal line (the so-called line of no-discrimination) from the left bottom to the top right corners (regardless of the positive and negative base rates).\n",

        "- The diagonal divides the ROC space. \n",
        " - Points above the diagonal represent good classification results (better than random).\n",

        "In this notebook, we have seen some of the metrics that scikit-learn provides for classification and also we have written our own functions from scratch. More specifically, we have seen how to compute and calculate: accuracy, balanced accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1 score, and also some interesting functionallities like the classification report, ROC curves, precision-recall curves and dummy classifiers.\n",
