        "In the notebook **take_image_from_webcam_as_numpy_array.ipynb** we have seen how to take an image from the webcam as a numpy array (in RGB format). As commented in this notebook, OpenCV provides a very simple interface to capture live stream with camera. To capture a video, you need to create a VideoCapture object (`cv2.VideoCapture()`). Its argument can be either the device index or the name of a video file. However, `cv2.VideoCapture()` does not work in Colab, because the previous method can only access hardware (e.g. webcam) connected locally. Therefore, accessing the webcam in Colab is not straightforward because the Notebook is executed remotelly.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we are going to see a workaround in order to provide an alternative implementation to `cv2.VideoCapture()` working on Colab.\n",
        "\n",
        "All credits should be given to [this repository](https://github.com/ricardodeazambuja/colab_utils). More specifically, [this file](https://github.com/ricardodeazambuja/colab_utils/blob/master/colab_utils/__init__.py) provides the implementation of `videoGrabber()`, which can access your webcam and retrieve frames from it. See next how to do it.\n",
